# Funnel Protocol
Funnel protocol is a staking platform on Babylon. Which provides chain abstraction for EVM chain stakers. Users earn yield on Bitcoin without having to interact with Bitcoin chain themselves.

The staking liquid token user receives is fBTC. We are building an ecosystem of apps for fBTC token hodlers. The users can bridge their fBTC to Funnel-Testnet powered by Alt Layer Raas.
